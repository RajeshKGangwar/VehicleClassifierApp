## Problem Statement
Raw Dataset in .pdf file format extension is given which consists of images of different vehicles. Using this dataset you need to prepare an Machine learning model which classifies vehicles in categories based on its body types i.e size such as Sedan, Hatchback, SUV, MUV etc. 



## Abstract
```bash
Intelligent vehicle detection and classification are becoming increasingly important in the field of highway management.
However due to the different sizes of vehicles, their detection remains a challenge that directly affects the accuracy 
of vehicle classification. The proposed solution encounters the problem statement and classifies the vehicle on basis of
its body type. Transfer learning approach with pretrained weights of Resnet50 classification model is used for the problem
statement.
```

## DEMO




## Data Gathering/Preprocessing
We have different images of vehicles in form of a pdf document. [Click here!](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QjfB6QME1mEPmvsSvPvoNTHqDiLbPdsO?usp=sharing) for downloading dataset.
Due to very less amount of dataset which could suffer our model from bad accuracy. Data Augmentation has been performed, Taking 10-15 Augmented images per image sample.
This helped in getting more amount of vehicle images, so that model has lot of data to learn and train itself for providing better results.

```bash
Refer the below file for the keras Data Augmentation code which is used for our problem statement use case.
```

## Model Training
Once pure data is collected by doing various feature engineering techniques. we have to feed this data to ML Model which is resnet50 in this case.
Find below the Google colab link for performing model training.

1. __How To Train__: Refer the provided Google colab shared file here ( [Model Training Colab File](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1B--xkd6duEJaql7ZUzlvUqwXV-4VGJaE?usp=sharing)). With respect to the dependencies for model training, please prefer using Tensorflow v2.2 for better compatiblity.
